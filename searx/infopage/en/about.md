    documents].

## Why use it?

- Moa may not give you as personalized results as Google, but it doesn't
    Create a profile about you
- SearXNG doesn't care what you search, it never shares anything with a
    third party, and cannot be used to compromise you.
- Moa is free software, 100% open source and everyone is welcome
    make it better.

If you care about privacy, you want to be an informed user, or believe it otherwise
In Digital Freedom, make MOA your default search engine or run it on your own
Your server!

## How do I set it as the default search engine?

MOA supports [OpenSearch]. For more information about changing your defaults
Search engine, see your browser documentation:

- [Firefox]
- [Microsoft Edge] - Behind the link you will also find helpful instructions
    For Chrome and Safari
- [Chromium] based browsers only add websites that the user navigates without
    one path.

When adding a search engine, there should not be duplicates of the same name. If
You encounter the problem that you cannot add a search engine, you can do one of the following:

- Remove duplicates (default name: SearXNG) or
- Contact the owner to give the instance a different name than the default.

## how it works?

MOA is a fork of SearXNG and it is also based on the famous [searx] [metasearch engine] that was
Inspired by [Project Seeks]. It provides basic privacy by blending you in
Search queries on other operating systems without saving search data. Moa
It can be added to your browser's search bar. In addition, it can be set as
Default search engine

{{link('stats page', 'stats')}} contains some useful anonymous applications
